    From Cummins & Masson (2014): "Surface water temperature and salinity have
    been measured daily at several BC lighthouse stations for many decades.
    [...] Water properties are measured from a
    bucket sample drawn from the top meter of the water column
    within an hour of local daytime high tide. Due to changes in instrumentation
    and measurement technique, the nominal uncertainty
    of the daily temperature and salinity observations has varied over
    time from 0.3 to 0.1 &deg;C and 0.03 to 0.3 psu, respectively (Peter
    Chandler, <i>pers. comm.</i>). The uncertainty on monthly averaged temperature
    and salinity data should be no greater than 0.1 &deg;C and
    0.1 psu, respectively."
